            Hello, it's me
            <br>I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
            <br>To go over everything
            <br>They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
            <br>Hello, can you hear me?
            <br>I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
            <br>When we were younger and free
            <br>I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
            
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">Pre-chorus:
            <br>There's such a difference between us
            <br>And a million miles
        </p>

        <p class="chorus">Chorus: 
            Hello from the other side
            <br>I must've called a thousand times
            <br>To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
            <br>But when I call, you never seem to be home
            <br>Hello from the outside
            <br>At least, I can say that I've tried
            <br>To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
            <br>But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
        </p>
        <p class="verse">Verse 2: 
            Hello, how are you?
            <br>It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
            <br>I hope that you're well
            <br>Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

        <p class="chorus">Pre-chorus:
                <br>It's no secret that the both of us
                <br>Are running out of time
            </p>
            
        
        <p class="chorus">Chorus:
            So hello from the other side (Other side)
            <br>I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
            <br>To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
            <br>But when I call, you never seem to be home
            <br>Hello from the outside (outside)
            <br>At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
            <br>To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
            <br>But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
